                <p>In this guide, we'll build a data generator, capable of populating DOM elements with a table of
                    random data. Below is an example of the output of the data generator.</p>

                <div class="output" id="ex1"></div>

                <p>The above table was generated simply by writing the following JavaScript:</p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
let peopleManager = new PeopleManager();

peopleManager.buildList(10);
peopleManager.displayAll(2, document.querySelector('ex1'));</pre>
                </code>

                <p>
                    In the above code, a <span class="js-class">PeopleManager</span> <span
                        class="codeRef">peopleManager</span> is instantiated and then two methods are called on the new
                    object:<br><span class="codeRef">peopleManager</span><span class="method">.buildList(10)</span> and
                    <span class="codeRef">peopleManager</span><span class="method">.displayAll(2, document.querySelector('ex1'))</span>. The first
                    method accepts the number of rows of data required and the second call actually displays the data in
                    the specified parent element, along with a number to specify when the header should be repeated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And here's the result of plugging in two different values:
                </p>
                <code>
                        <pre>
let peopleManager2 = new PeopleManager();

peopleManager2.buildList(23);
peopleManager2.displayAll(8, document.querySelector('#ex2'));</pre>
                    </code>
                <div class="output" id="ex2"></div>
                <p>
                    So let's have a look at what goes into creating functionality like this. First, we will create a
                    JavaScript class to hold each data object, called <span class="js-class">Person</span>:
                </p>
                <code>
                        <pre>
export class Person {
    constructor(name, age, email) {
        this._name = name;
        this._age = age;
        this._email = email;
    }
}</pre>
                </code>
                <p>
                    All we have here is a simple class to hold some information about the data we'll be displaying later on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now we'll explore the part of the program that does all the work, <span class="js-class">PeopleManager</span>.
                </p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
import { Person } from './person.js';

const output = document.querySelector('#output');
const names = ["Natalia", "Nick", "Timmy", "Ellen", "Jade", "Charles", "Joe", "Brad", "Sally", "Silly", "Jack", "Mark", "Mick", "Sue", "Jenny"];
const domains = ["facebook", "google", "yahoo", "amazon", "youtube", "gmail", "outlook", "hotmail"];
const tlds = ["com", "biz", "gov", "net", "org", "io"];

export class PeopleManager {
    constructor() {
        this.peopleArr = [];
    }
    buildList(num) {
        for (let i = 0; i < num; i++) {
            this.peopleArr.push(new Person(
                this.randomElement(names),
                this.randomNum(100),
                this.createEmail(this.randomElement(names))
            ));
        }
    }

    displayAll(rptHeader, prt) {
        . . .
    }

    randomElement(arr) {
        . . .
    }

    randomNum(max) {
        . . .
    createEmail(str) {
        . . .
    }
}</pre>
            </code>
            <p>
                The constructor takes no arguments, but initialises an empty array. This array will hold the randomly generated <span class="js-class">Person</span> objects. At the top of this file, you can see some arrays that will be used to create the random <span class="js-class">Person</span> objects, via methods of the <span class="js-class">PeopleManager</span> class.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first <strong>method</strong> defined in <span class="js-class">PeopleManager</span> is <span class="codeRef">buildList(num)</span>. It takes in one value, the number of data items to create. A <span class="codeRef">for</span> loop iterates over the build process for the specified number. During the object building process, the following steps are carried out:<br><br>
                <span class="point">The <span class="js-class">PeopleManager</span>.<span class="codeRef">peopleArr[]</span> has an anonymous <span class="js-class">Person</span> pushed onto it</span>
                <span class="point">For each member property of the <span class="js-class">Person</span> a method of <span class="js-class">PeopleManager</span> is called</span>
                <span class="point">The first one is <span class="codeRef">randomElement(names)</span>, which takes in an array (we'll see how it works soon)
                <span class="point">The other two methods are very similar to <span class="codeRef">randomElement(names)</span></span>
                
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's look at <span class="codeRef">randomElement(names)</span>
            </p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
randomElement(arr) {
    return arr[Math.floor(Math.random() * arr.length)];
}                    </pre>
                </code>
                <p>
                    That may look a little bit confusing, but the closer you look at it, the more you'll see some familiar things. The argument passed in is a reference to an array. In this case it's a global variable declared at the top of the module (there are better ways of doing this!). Then there's a <strong>return</strong> statement, that is just returning the array that was passed in. And that's exactly what's happening. The part that may seem confusing is how the element is indexed. Here's a break down: <br><br>
                    <span class="point">The static <span class="codeRef">Math</span> object is used for two of its methods</span>
                    <span class="point">The method <span class="codeRef">random()</span> returns a pseudo random number between 0 and 1</span>
                    <span class="point">That number is multiplied by the length of the passed in array</span>
                    <span class="point">Then the results of all that are passed to <span class="codeRef">Math.floor()</span> that returns an integer version of result</span>
                    <span class="point">This final result is used as the array index, to select an element</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This method allows an array of <em>any</em> size to be passed in and a random object could be returned each time. As an exercise, see if you can expand this expression into simpler parts. In other words, perform this current single line operation into a multi line operation. You could use as many as four.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So the return value from <span class="codeRef">randomElement(names)</span> is now ready to use in the <span class="js-class">Person</span> constructor that will end up creating an anonymous object to push onto the <span class="js-class">PeopleManager</span>'s array, each time through the <strong>for</strong> loop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next we have <span class="codeRef">randomNum(100)</span> being called with an input of '100'. Using the same <strong>Math</strong> built in methods from earlier, this simple method just returns a random number between 0 and the number passed in.
                </p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
randomNum(max) {
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * max);
} </pre>
                </code>
                <p>
                    The final random property to be generated is returned from a call to <span class="codeRef">createEmail()</span>. 
                </p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
createEmail(str) {
    return `${str.toLowerCase()}@${this.randomElement(domains)}.${this.randomElement(tlds)}`;
} </pre>
                </code>
                <p>
                    This method uses the previous two methods to build a string, representing an email. The names do not have any relationship to the names generated for the other <span class="js-class">Person</span> property. This was purely to show more usage of the method.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And that's it for producing our objects. The <span class="js-class">PeopleManager</span> now has an array as a member, filled with anonymous <span class="js-class">Person</span> objects. Next, we'll look at how to display this data structure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The easy part now is to just print out the data to the screen! Below is the code for the method 
                </p>
                    <code>
                        <pre>
displayAll(rptHeader, prt) {
    prt.innerHTML = "";
    prt.innerHTML += `&lt;div class="row"&gt;`;
    Object.keys(this.peopleArr[0]).forEach(x => {
        prt.innerHTML += `&lt;span class="item bold"&gt;${x.slice(1,)}&lt;/span&gt;`
    });
    prt.innerHTML += `&lt;/div&gt;`;
    this.peopleArr.forEach((x, i) => {
        if (i % rptHeader === 0 && i !== 0) {
            prt.innerHTML += `&lt;div class="row"&gt;`;
            Object.keys(x).forEach(y => prt.innerHTML += `&lt;span class="item bold"&gt;${y.slice(1,)}&lt;/span&gt;`);
            prt.innerHTML += `&lt;/div&gt;`;
        }

        prt.innerHTML += `&lt;div class="row"&gt;`;
        Object.values(x).forEach(x => prt.innerHTML += `&lt;span class="item"&gt;${x}&lt;//span&gt;`);
        prt.innerHTML += `&lt;/div&gt;`;
    })
}                        </pre>
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        The data is printed, with a header. The interesting thing is, the information about what to use as the column titles, comes from the <span class="js-class">Person</span> itself. This information is returned by using a method on the <span class="codeRef">Object</span> global <strong>object.</strong> 
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        <pre>
Object.keys(this.peopleArr[0]);
                        </pre>
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        A reference to the first <span class="js-class">Person</span> in the <span class="js-class">PeopleManager</span> object's array is passed to the <strong>keys()</strong> method of the <span class="js-class">Object</span> <strong>object.</strong> This method returns an array listing the 'keys' of the object passed in. This provides the necessary column header values.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first character of each <strong>key</strong>  is 'sliced' because the name of each property is proceeded with an underscore. The resulting string is wrapped in an HTML <strong>span</strong> element.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The process of displaying the actual data is very similar to above, and you can see from the code that more <strong>span</strong> elements are constructed for each column of each row. There is a check to see if another header needs to be inserted, and that's it!
                    </p>
                    <p>Hopefully this quick guide has shown you a little bit about objects, arrays and how to work with each.</p>
